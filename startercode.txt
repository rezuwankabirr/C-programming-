//Using codeblocks as the platform to code.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <math.h>

int main (void) {

printf ("Hello World\n");

return 0;}

/*
printf is a command used to print something on the screen printf is used like such
printf ("ENTER CODE");
the punctuations are really important in c using them wrong will cause the program to not work at all
For example-
printf (Hello World); This program will not function because there is no quotation mark.
You can see that I have used \n at the end of the sentence I wrote.
\n allows us to add a new line at the end of the statement.
In C you must use library names on top i used some basic ones such as #include <stdio.h>, #include <string.h> and more
After that you should use
int main ()
 {
CODE CODE CODE
Now with this you can write your own C programming!!
return 0;}

//You can use 1 library name on top but I used like 4 because it looks cooler (THERE ARE A LOT OF LIBRARY NAMES THEY GIVE US SPECIAL FEATURES USE AS MANY AS YOU WANT!)
